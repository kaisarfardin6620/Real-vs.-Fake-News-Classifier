# Real-vs.-Fake-News-Classifier

This project aims to build a system that can automatically detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The proliferation of fake news has become a major concern in recent years. This project tackles the challenge by developing a model that can classify news articles as either fake or real. By leveraging natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to provide a reliable tool for identifying potentially misleading information.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the "fake_or_real_news.csv" dataset, which contains a collection of news articles labeled as either fake or real. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the fake news detection model.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to remove irrelevant information, handle missing values, and convert textual data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features are extracted from the text data, such as word counts, n-grams, and TF-IDF values. These features serve as inputs to the machine learning models.

3. **Model Selection and Training:** Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and ANN are evaluated. The most suitable model is selected based on its performance on the test data.

4. **Evaluation:** The performance of the model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify fake news articles.

## Results

The project demonstrates promising results in detecting fake news with high accuracy. The chosen model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy score here] on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between fake and real news articles.

## Conclusion

This project contributes to the fight against fake news by providing a tool for identifying potentially misleading information. The developed system can be further improved by incorporating more advanced techniques and exploring larger datasets.
